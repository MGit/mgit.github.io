            <h1>Martin Guay</h1>
            <div class="bio">
                I lead R&D at the intersection of graphics, AI and human-computer interaction.

 <!--I drive innovation in AI and visual technology to deliver forward-looking solutions across film, gaming, and interactive media.-->

                In 2018, I established <a href="#" onclick="navigateToTheme('📸 Motion Capture'); return false;" class="bio-link">marker-less motion capture capabilities</a> and in-camera VFX called <I>synth2track</I> used by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) and Marvel.
                
                 More recently, I established <a href="#" onclick="navigateToTheme('🖱️ Deep Motion Authoring'); return false;" class="bio-link">Deep Motion Authoring </a> which renders creating natural motion much more accessible. 
                
                 Prior to this, I pioneered <a href="#" onclick="navigateToTheme('🖱️ Deep Motion Authoring'); return false;" class="bio-link">
                    autonomous characters driven by voice, terrain and music</a>, to enable conversational interactions, digital bands that can play any song and 3D character agents that navigate environments. </p>
            </p>
                <p>During my Ph.D. I ellucidated artistic principles that help artists establish clear visual communication when drawing, 
                    and turned these into  <a href="#" onclick="navigateToTheme('✍️ Sketch-based Interfaces'); return false;" class="bio-link">
                        new sketch-based interfaces</a> for 3D motion authoring. 
                I started my career in video game production <a href="#" onclick="navigateToTheme('🎮 Video Games Dev'); return false;" class="bio-link">developping game engines </a>dfor different platforms such as the XBox, PC and iPhone.
