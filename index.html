            <h1>Martin Guay</h1>
            <div class="bio">
                I lead the research and development of innovative technologies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, graphics, and human-computer interaction.

 <!--I drive innovation in AI and visual technology to deliver forward-looking solutions across film, gaming, and interactive media.-->

                In 2018, I established <a href="#" onclick="navigateToTheme('📸 Marker-less Capture & Tracking'); return false;" class="bio-link">marker-less motion capture capabilities</a> and in-camera VFX called <I>synth2track</I>, which is operated today by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM).
                
                 More recently, I established <a href="#" onclick="navigateToTheme('🤖 GenAI Motion Models'); return false;" class="bio-link">genAI for 3D motion </a> for fast motion authoring and editing; both at Pixar and ILM. 
                Prior to this, I pioneered <a href="#" onclick="navigateToTheme('🤖 GenAI Motion Models'); return false;" class="bio-link">generative conversation models for 3D AI avatars</a> and chat bots, that understand and speak with people.</p>
            </p>
                <p>During my Ph.D. I mathematically ellucidated artistic principles that yield clear visual communication and leveragged optimization to design  <a href="#" onclick="navigateToTheme('✍️ Intuitive Interfaces for 3D Authoring'); return false;" class="bio-link">new interfaces</a> 
                    for automatically authoring compelling 3D movements. 

                Physics simulation increase the immersive experience of 3D content and I conceived new approximations of the Navier-stokes equations that simplify the <a href="#" onclick="navigateToTheme('🔥 Simulation and Control'); return false;" class="bio-link">simulation</a> of 3D fluids; rendering fire and water effects more accessible to a greater audience. 
                Then I created fully simulated characters that---similar to robots in the real world---react in a unique and realistic way to every interaction. 
     
                <p>
                During my career, I had the privilege of experiencing both long term research and short term production. I started my journey in production developping and optimizing
                <a href="#" onclick="navigateToTheme('🎮 Video Games Development'); return false;" class="bio-link">video games</a> on various platforms.
